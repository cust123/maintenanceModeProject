# maintenanceModeProject

This is just a side project, the idea of this came when i was working on Prod Server and wanted to switch to maintenance mode. the but website had no maintenance mode implemented.

# main reason for this

the main idea of this is to create a maintenance mode in the website, is to provide an ease to the development teams to switch between modes in case of any
updates or issues in the system that needs prompt actions and to go offline,.

# Careful considerations

Dynamic Maintenance Check: For a more dynamic approach, you might want to set up a server-side mechanism to toggle maintenance mode and communicate it to your JavaScript code, such as through an API endpoint that the JavaScript file could query.

Security: Ensure that any maintenance mode check does not inadvertently expose security vulnerabilities. The approach described here is intended for development and testing purposes. For production environments, consider server-side checks to ensure secure and reliable maintenance mode activation.

This setup allows you to enable and disable maintenance mode simply by appending a query parameter to your URL, which is useful for testing. For a production environment, you'll likely want to use a more robust method involving server-side checks.
